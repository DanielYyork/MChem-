To use this code, 2 files are required (per molecule set - e.g. 2 files for algae):

'*.smi' file - this contains the smiles of each molecule 
'*.names' file - this contains the names of molecules corresponding to the smiles strings

Must be in the same order (e.g. smilestring #1 should be for molecule name #1 and so on).
